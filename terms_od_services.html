    Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Inside my fridge, organization (“Inside my fridge” or “We” or “Us”),
    which
    operates the web site located at xxx.xxx.xx and related application programming interfaces (API’s), mobile
    applications and online services (the “Website”). The following Terms of Service are a legal contract between you
    (“You”)
    and Inside my fridge regarding your use of the Website. Visitors and users of the Website are referred to
    individually as
    “User” and collectively as “Users”.
  </p>

  <p>
    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY REGISTERING FOR, ACCESSING, BROWSING, OR USING THE WEBSITE,
    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS,
    INCLUDING
    THE INSIDE MY FRIDGE PRIVACY NOTICE AND ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES (AS DEFINED BELOW) (COLLECTIVELY, THE “TERMS”).
  </p>

  <p>
    IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU PROVIDE CONSENT FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER WITH THE WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO
    BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RESPECT OF SUCH CHILD’S USE OF THE WEBSITE.
  </p>

  <p>1. Eligibility; Accounts. THE WEBSITE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO (A) ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE
    WEBSITE BY KHAN ACADEMY OR (B) ANY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13 WHOSE REGISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY A LEGAL
    PARENT OR GUARDIAN. By clicking the “I Agree” button or by otherwise using or registering an account for the
    Website,
    You represent (a) that You have not been previously suspended or removed from the Website by Khan Academy; (b) that
    You are either (i) at least 13 years of age or (ii) Your parent and/or guardian has consented to Your use of the
    Website; and (c) that your registration and your use of the Website is in compliance with any and all applicable
    laws
    and regulations.</p>
  <p>1.1 Account. In order to use certain features of the Website, you must register for an account. You may be asked to
    provide a password in connection with your account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
    of
    your account and password, and You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account
    or
    password. You agree that the information You provide to Khan Academy, whether at registration or at any other time,
    will be true, accurate, current, and complete. You also agree that You will ensure that this information is kept
    accurate and up-to-date at all times. If You have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in
    the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID or password), then You agree to
    immediately notify Khan Academy at info@khanacademy.org. You may be liable for the losses incurred by Khan Academy
    or
    others due to any unauthorized use of your Website account.</p>
  <p>1.2 Integrated Service. Khan Academy may permit You to register for the Website through, or otherwise associate
    your
    Khan Academy account with, certain third party social networking or integrated services, such as Facebook Connect
    and
    Google (“Integrated Service”). By registering for the Website using (or otherwise granting access to) an Integrated
    Service, you agree that Khan Academy may access your Integrated Service’s account information, and you agree to any
    and all terms and conditions of the Integrated Service regarding your use of the Website via the Integrated Service.
    You agree that any Integrated Service is a Reference Site (as defined below) and you are solely responsible for your
    interactions with the Integrated Service as a result of accessing the Website through the Integrated Service. Khan
    Academy does not control the practices of Integrated Services, and you are advised to read the Privacy Policy and
    terms and conditions of any Integrated Service that you use to understand their practices.</p>
  <p>1.3 Child User. If You are a User of the Website and are under the age of 13 (“Child User”), You may not register
    an
    account for the Website without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian. A Child User that begins
    the
    registration process for himself or herself without a Parent User may have the registration process restricted until
    a
    Parent User approves or assumes responsibility for the Child User account. Additionally, a Child User may use the
    Website if registered through certain educational organizations or, in certain cases (as defined below), by Coaches
    that have entered into a relationship directly with Khan Academy and through which education organization or Coach
    the
    legal parent and/or guardian of such Child User has consented to use of the Website. Further, in certain instances,
    a
    Child User may use our Website via one of the third party applications that integrate into or with the Website. A
    Child User that has registered through such external educational organizations, third party applications, or Coaches
    will only be permitted to use the Website for so long as Khan Academy reasonably believes that such access has been
    consented to by the Child User’s parent or guardian.</p>
  <p>1.4 Parent User. If You are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a child that seeks
    to
    register as a Child User of the Website, You may register a parent account on the Website (“Parent User”). As a
    Parent
    User, you may create, register, manage and approve Child User accounts only for your own child(ren) or child(ren)
    for
    whom you are a legal guardian. IF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR
    ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER’S LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO
    BE
    BOUND BY THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE
    WEBSITE
    BY THE CHILD USER. You acknowledge that Khan Academy may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either
    directly or through third parties, that Khan Academy deems necessary to validate Your registration information,
    including without limitation engaging third parties to provide verification services. Khan Academy reserves all
    rights
    to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their
    identity. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KHAN ACADEMY CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY
    INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND KHAN ACADEMY IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING
    ANY
    USER’S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR A COACH DURING
    REGISTRATION
    IS SUCH CHILD USER’S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN. A Parent User account, along with all associated Child User
    accounts,
    may be terminated by Khan Academy at any time and without warning for any failure to abide by these Terms.</p>
  <p>1.5 Coach. Khan Academy may make available certain features and tools that permit certain Users (such as, for
    example,
    representatives of school districts, schools, teachers, and other educators) to work with students and other Users
    through the Website in order to provide such students and other Users with tutorial, educational and other
    education-related services, and to review and evaluate educational achievement and progress of such students and
    other
    Users (each a “Coach”). If you are a Coach, you must use Khan Academy’s Coach registration process when registering
    accounts on the Website for one or more of your students. IF YOU ARE A COACH AND YOU REGISTER AN ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD
    USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED EXPRESS CONSENT FROM SUCH CHILD USER’S PARENT OR LEGAL
    GUARDIAN
    FOR YOU TO REGISTER THE CHILD USER FOR THE WEBSITE AND FOR YOU TO PROVIDE TO KHAN ACADEMY THE INFORMATION YOU
    DISCLOSE
    IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGISTRATION OF SUCH CHILD USER. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, YOU FURTHER AGREE TO BE
    BOUND
    BY THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY
    THE CHILD USER, FOR SO LONG AS THE CHILD USER IS NOT OTHERWISE ASSOCIATED WITH OR ASSUMED BY A VALID PARENT USER
    ACCOUNT. You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Khan Academy against any and all claims, losses,
    liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (a) your violation of
    any
    provision, representation or warranty this Section 1.5; (b) the use of the Website by the Child User; (c) your
    failure
    to obtain sufficient parental or legal guardian consent; (d) your registration of the Child User, or (e) any other
    action related to the Child User.</p>

  <p>2. Privacy Notice. Your privacy is important to Khan Academy. Please read the Khan Academy Privacy Notice, hereby
    incorporated into the Terms, carefully for information relating to Khan Academy’s collection, use, and disclosure of
    Your personal information.
